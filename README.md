OpenMesh practices

The first practice uses ANN, GSL and OpenMesh libraries to achieve the ICP meshes alignment algorithm. 
With ANN library, kd-tree is built to find nearest neighbour points. Matrices computing is available in GSL library.
UI is built in MFC. (A bug is found when degree 180 bunny is used as the 2nd mesh)
