OpenMesh practices

The first practice uses ANN, GSL and OpenMesh libraries to achieve the ICP meshes alignment algorithm. 
With ANN library, kd-tree is built to find nearest neighbour points. Matrices computing is available in GSL library.
UI is built in MFC. (A bug is found when try to align more than 3 meshes)
